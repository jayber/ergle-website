                Email hits your inbox like a rock down a well until you come along and deal with it. This means that:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>no none else can act and</li>
                <li>you have to.</li>
            </ol>

        <em>Hard drives are the same.</em> You manually share each
        file. Shared file systems are no better: who knows where to find
        anything without asking?
    </p>
    <p>
        An intranet is another place to hide information. People find things the only way they know how: they
        email someone - back to paragraph 1.

        <em>We use lots of systems.</em> That's great: they all do different things.
    </p>
    <p>
        But we need <em>one place</em> that reflects the work we do everywhere, allowing us to share it automatically and securely,
        with just one place to look.
